### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame

#the name should be check_for_ace. CardGame. needs to be added to it to make it a class instance
#It should say which card number e.g card1.
# there should be == (it is equal to 1) rather than assigning it with just an =

  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end
# It is written dif instead of def. there needs to be a comma (,) between card1 and card2
# it says return card when it should be card1.
#1 to many ends, self needs added to make it a class instance
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end
#total needs a value eg = 0 or []
#the return needs to #{} the total in side the ""
def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end
